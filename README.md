# Machine Learning to Predict Transportation Demand

## About the Project
This project uses Machine Learning to predict transportation demand based on historical data. The goal is to optimize vehicle allocation, improving the efficiency of transportation services.

## Dataset Used
The data was obtained from Kaggle's **[Rides Demand and Supply Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)**. This dataset contains information about the demand and supply of rides, such as:
- **Active drivers per hour**
- **Active passengers per hour**
- **Completed rides**

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Scikit-learn** (for predictive modeling)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)

## Data Visualization
The project includes exploratory data analysis and graphical display to understand demand patterns and predictive model performance.

### Run the Prediction Script
```bash
python demanda_transporte.py
```

## Results
Results include:
- Prediction of transport demand at different times
- Graphs comparing actual and predicted values
- Analysis of forecast errors
